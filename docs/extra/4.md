## Week 4 Homework

## Reading

1. book (Chapter  1, section 1.3):  Fuzzing for  Software Security  Testing and  Quality Assurance. Ari Takanen,  Jared DeMott,  Charlie Miller
2. Godefroid, Patrice. "Fuzzing: Hack, art, and science." Communications of the ACM 63.2 (2020): 70-76.
3. Stephens, Nick, et al. "Driller: Augmenting fuzzing through selective symbolic execution." NDSS. Vol. 16. No. 2016. 
4. Dolan-Gavitt, Brendan, et al. "Lava: Large-scale automated vulnerability addition." 2016 IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (SP). IEEE, 2016.
5. 
 ## Exercices:

1. For an unknown input file format, which of the fuzzing types is more appropriate-- mutational or generative (grammar) and why?
2. What are shortcomings of blackbox fuzzing \[hint: what is the proxy metric for a good fuzzer?\]
3. Read the article "Fuzzing: Hack, Art, and Science" [pdf link](https://patricegodefroid.github.io/public_psfiles/Fuzzing-101-CACM2020.pdf) and answer the following questions:
	1. Why fuzzing is more challenging for netwroked/server type applications?
	2. On page 74, 3rd column, it is written "Note that full program statement coverage is a "necessary but not sufficient" condition to find all the bugs in a program.". Can you elaborate this statement why it is necessary but not sufficient?
	3. In general, which fuzzing type is suitable for fuzzing XML and C code parsers/compiler?

 ## Answers (do not check this before you try to answer the exercices alone)

1. Mutation based is more appropriate. As we do not know the structure of the file, we need to randomly mutate inputs. Check Slide 16 in the lecture.

2. In Blackbox fuzzing, only interface is known so we cannot apply any sort of analysis. Remember fuzzing is a balancing act.

3. Read the paper :)

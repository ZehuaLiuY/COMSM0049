## Exercices:
1. Design conceptually the steps necessary to deploy a rootkit.

2. Explain how TPM could be used to detect rootkits.

3. Compare Intel SGX and ARM Trustzone.

<!--
 ## Answers (do not check this before you try to answer the exercices alone)

1. Check slide 4 in the lecture

2. The use of autheticated boot will stop any rootkits, it is designed to prevent root kits being installed at boot time.
  
3. Intel SGX creates a secure enclave to run sensitive operations however ARM Trustzone divides the OS into trusted and untrusted zones, where sensitive software/applications run in the trusted zone and normal applications run in the untrusted zone.
